# Nagios® TYPO3 Monitoring

## Description

**Nagios®** is the industry standard in open source server/service/network monitoring. This plugin for Nagios® reads and parses information about the TYPO3 instance and reports the status to the Nagios® core.

Depending to the configuration (the plugin and Nagios® itself), Nagios® detects a specific state (warning or critical) and runs its notification or event handling procedures.

In short words: this plugin in combination with the [TYPO3 extension](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/nagios) allows system administrators/managers to detect things such as outdated/insecure TYPO3 extensions, outdated/insecure TYPO3 core installations, incompatible PHP versions, etc.
